2 alert - for pop up
3 document.getElementById(" ").innerHTML=" ";


Types of Pop-up Box
1 Alert
2 Confirm
3 Prompt

For input we use prompt
For confirmation we use confirm
For output we use alert


Operators :-
1. Arithmetic Operators
2. Assignment Operators
3. Comparision Operators
4. Logical Operators
5. Conditional Opertors


Arithmetic Operators - 
Addition          -       +
Subtraction       -       -
Multiplication    -       *
Division          -       /
Increment         -       ++
Decrement         -       --

Assignment Operators - 
x+=y           x = x+y
x-=y           x = x-y
x*=y           x = x*y
x/=y           x = x/y


Logical Operator - 
Logical AND      -      &&
Logical OR       -      ||
Logical NOT      -      !


Comparision Operator - 
==           -       equal to
===          -       equals to value and equal to type
!=           -       not equal to
!==          -       not equal to value and not equal to type
>            -       greater than
<            -       less than
>=           -       greater than or equal to 
<=           -       less than or equal to  


Functions - 
A JavaScript function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task.
A JavaScript function is executed when "something" invokes it (calls it).
A JavaScript function is defined with the function keyword, followed by a name, followed by parentheses ().

Function names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs (same rules as variables).

The parentheses may include parameter names separated by commas:
(parameter1, parameter2, ...)

The code inside the function will execute when "something" invokes (calls) the function
You can reuse code: Define the code once, and use it many times.



Cookies - 
Cookies are data, stored in small text files, on your computer.
When a web server has sent a web page to a browser, the connection is shut down, and the server forgets everything about the user.

Cookies were invented to solve the problem "how to remember information about the user":

When a user visits a web page, his/her name can be stored in a cookie.
Next time the user visits the page, the cookie "remembers" his/her name.


UTC - Coordinated Universal Time or UTC is the primary time standard by which the world regulates clocks and time.
